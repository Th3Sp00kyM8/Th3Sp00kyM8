Welcome. I study how things work: systems, people, ideas and what they reveal when tested. Most of what’s here is exploration and experimentation. I build to understand, document to remember, and share because it keeps me honest about what I actually know.

**The Small Enjoyments of My Life:**

- 📚 Books
- 😂 Memes

- 🪶 Defying Gravity
- ❤️ Concerning My Loved Ones

**Current Obsessions:**

- 🔐 Cybersecurity — To impress the ladies and by ladies, I mean the honeypots that don't call back.
- 🧠 Building a Home Lab — Satisfying my desire to buy things. 
- 📖 Reading Kokoro — A reminder that understanding others often starts with realizing how little we understand ourselves.
- 🍛 Eating Biryani — Satisfying my desire of a full stomach.
- 🫀 Being Human — In Beta.
